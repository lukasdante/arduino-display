# Arduino and LCD Display Lyrics Parser

Arduino is a microcontroller that has been used in several applications in different fields including entertainment, disaster mitigation, and simple projects. In this project, we integrated a 16x2 LCD Display to the Arduino Uno R3 in a TinkerCAD simulation. The 16x2 LCD Display is limited to projecting 16 characters in 2 rows. With this script, a user can parse any song lyrics to be displayed in the LCD display. Each line of the song will be separated into 16-character chunks.

## Steps in Using the Script
1. Paste the lyrics text to the lyric.txt file.
2. Run the script.
3. Paste the code in the TinkerCAD simulation code editor.
4. Manually adjust the delays for each line.
5. Run the simulation.
