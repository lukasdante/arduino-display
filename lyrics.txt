You got, you got the cinema
It's you
And I'm not gettin' over it
Darlin', is it cool
If I'm stubborn when it comes to this?
I guess we're in time

If you're getting yourself wet for me
I guess you're all mine
You're sleeping in this bed with me
I just think you're cool
I dig your cinema
Do you think I'm cool too?
Or am I too into you?
Tell me what you want and you got it, love
I want all of you, gimme all you got
That's cinema
That's cinema, uh-huh
